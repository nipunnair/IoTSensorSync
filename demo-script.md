# IoT Sensor Dashboard Demo Script (2-3 minutes)

## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Outline

### Opening (15 seconds)
**"Today I'll demonstrate our new IoT Sensor Data Collection & Processing Pipeline - a comprehensive solution for real-time monitoring and analysis of industrial sensor data."**

*Show: Main dashboard landing page*

---

### Section 1: Real-time Data Collection (30 seconds)
**"First, let me show you the live data collection capabilities."**

**Actions to demonstrate:**
1. Click "Start" button in the sidebar
2. Show real-time metrics updating (Total Readings counter)
3. Point out the current sensor readings with delta changes
4. Show the 4 sensor types: Temperature, Weight, Moisture, Pressure

**Narration:** 
*"The system continuously collects data from multiple IoT sensors. You can see temperature in Celsius, weight in kilograms, moisture percentage, and atmospheric pressure - all updating in real-time with trend indicators."*

---

### Section 2: Live Visualizations (45 seconds)
**"The dashboard provides comprehensive real-time visualizations."**

**Actions to demonstrate:**
1. Stay on Real-time Dashboard tab
2. Point out the 4-panel time series chart
3. Show how data points are being added live
4. Highlight the different colored lines for each sensor

**Narration:**
*"Each sensor has its own dedicated chart showing trends over time. You can see how temperature and moisture are inversely correlated - as temperature rises, moisture typically decreases. The weight sensor shows gradual changes, while pressure remains relatively stable with minor atmospheric variations."*

---

### Section 3: Data Processing Pipeline (45 seconds)
**"Let's examine our data processing capabilities."**

**Actions to demonstrate:**
1. Click "Data Processing" tab
2. Show data quality metrics
3. Point out outlier detection results
4. Demonstrate cleaning options (checkboxes)
5. Click "Process Data" button
6. Show before/after comparison tables

**Narration:**
*"The system automatically analyzes data quality, detecting outliers and missing values. Our processing pipeline includes configurable cleaning options - outlier removal, missing value interpolation, and data smoothing. You can see the before and after comparison showing how the data is cleaned and optimized."*

---

### Section 4: Advanced Analytics (30 seconds)
**"The analytics engine provides deep insights into sensor performance."**

**Actions to demonstrate:**
1. Click "Analytics" tab
2. Show statistical summary table
3. Point out correlation matrix heatmap
4. Scroll to trend analysis metrics
5. Show distribution histograms

**Narration:**
*"Our analytics engine calculates comprehensive statistics, correlation analysis, and trend detection. The correlation matrix shows relationships between sensors, while trend analysis provides slope, confidence intervals, and directional indicators for each measurement."*

---

### Section 5: Data Explorer & Export (20 seconds)
**"Finally, let's look at data exploration and export capabilities."**

**Actions to demonstrate:**
1. Click "Data Explorer" tab
2. Show date filtering options
3. Demonstrate sensor selection
4. Show filtered data table
5. Point out export options in sidebar

**Narration:**
*"Users can filter data by date ranges and sensor types, explore relationships through custom visualizations, and export cleaned data in CSV or JSON formats for further analysis or model building."*

---

### Closing (15 seconds)
**"This solution provides end-to-end IoT data management - from real-time collection through processing to advanced analytics - ready for integration with existing systems and ML pipelines."**

*Show: Return to main dashboard with active simulation*
